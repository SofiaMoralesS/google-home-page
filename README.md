all i can say its that i'm so happy because of how things are turning out
I though previously how i was going to give shape to the elements on the screen and then started making the boxes were they were going to fit in...

i'ts always important to think of the process before start coding

i'm having a little trouble with the structure so it will stuck in place but that ain't happening at the moment   

today y learn a lot about **box-shadow** its the coolest property so far even though I practice a little with it before this is the first time I used it properly and its realy interesting how it works.

self-note: if you're using flex you can't give containers specific size to width or height
