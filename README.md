## creating a google home page mini-proyect



this proyect will be done to verify skills progress learn at the odin project.


all i can say its that i'm so happy because of how things are turning out
I though previously how i was going to give shape to the elements on the screen and then started making the boxes were they were going to fit in...

i'ts always important to think of the process before start coding

i'm having a little trouble with the structure so it will stuck in place but that ain't happening at the moment
